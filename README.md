All parts of this project belong to me. I had troubles running my code on the blue server and asked ChatGPT a question 
about it, it was my main that wasn't processing the name of the input file correctly, once I fixed that it ran on blue 
with no problems. This was during the second phase. The third phase I asked how it would implement a class for this project 
just to see if there was difference in the suggested version and chatGPT's version. I ended up using the suggested as 
it was clearer to me. 

This project's main goal is to use the scanner class to tokenize text, build a bst from there, then take it one step further 
and create a huffman tree based on frequencies using a priority queue. Then to generate a codebook to encode and decode text. 
This is the final part of the project that completes all criteria. 

When testing my code I used the test prompts that were given. After running the test prompts I had 44 matches and 0 diffs.
