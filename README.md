All parts of this project belong to me. I had troubles running my code on the blue server and asked ChatGPT a question 
about it, it was my main that wasn't processing the name of the input file correctly, once I fixed that it ran on blue 
with no problems.

I implemented many functions to build on part 1 of this project. I have now implemented a binary search tree class that
stores unique words and their frequencies. It contains functions such as, insertion, lookup, size/height and in order traversal 
There is also now a Priority Queue class, which maintains TreeNode*s ordered first by higher frequency. It uses functions 
such as insert, findMin, extractMin, and deleteMin. Keeping track of frequencies and sorting nodes is now possible.
Next step is to put them into a huffman tree (part 3).

When testing my code I used the test prompts that were given. After running the test prompts I had 22 matches and 0 diffs.
